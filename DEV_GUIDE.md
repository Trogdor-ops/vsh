# Goals

vsh, the client part, should work seamlessly on Linux, FreeBSD, OSX and Solaris. Please, no optimizations that break compability.

vshd is a script that figures out which operating system it is installed on and then run the real script in libexec.

All scripts should be able to work on a clean minimal install. Maybe not always possible, but we could atleast try.
